I created separated repository becouse author of tutroial create  all projects in one repository. So it is almost one to one copy.


To run do followed things:


* `npm install` (then install necessary dependiencies in my case are below)
* `npm install reflect-metadata@0.1.2 --S`
* `npm install rxjs@5.0.0-beta.6 --S`


Then run server with hot reload:

* `npm run-script typescript`
* `npm start`
